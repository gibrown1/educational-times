# educational-times
GitHub repo containing code for my capstone project, https://educational-times.herokuapp.com

  This is my capstone project, which is currently still a work in progress with my partner Logan Schmidt (lbschmidt1@catamount.wcu.edu). This website's purpose is to display data from a British publication called the Educational Times, specifically data on mathematical questions and solutions that were sent in to be published. This data was compiled by Dr. Jim Tattersall of Providence College, and we are working with suggestions from Dr. Sloan Despeaux who is doing research on this data in order to ease her research as up until now this data has only been acessible through Dr. Tattersall. As one can see by visiting the website, there are a few different ways to search through the data including an index of the authors, a simple search by author's name, and an advanced search to search by any field. In the future, we will be adding a statistics page to give some intersting information about the data as well.
  
  While developing this website, I did a great deal of the CSS styling of the page, as well as creating most of the HTML files that were used. All of the rest of the backend coding was split pretty well between my partner and I, as he and I partner coded most of the backend though he set up the database on Heroku when we had to make the quick change between Heroku and the Google Cloud Platform last semester. 
  
  Please let me know if you have any further questions, as I will be happy to answer them!
